he price for BFGoodrich All-Terrain T/A KO2 tires in size 265/75R16 varies depending on the retailer:

1. **Stock Tire (265/70R16)**:
    - Diameter = 16 inches (wheel) + 2 * (70% of 265 mm in inches)
    - 265 mm = 10.43 inches
    - Sidewall height = 70% of 10.43 inches = 7.301 inches
    - Total diameter = 16 inches + 2 * 7.301 inches = **30.602** inches
2. **New Tire (265/75R16)**:
    - Diameter = 16 inches (wheel) + 2 * (75% of 265 mm in inches)
    - 265 mm = 10.43 inches
    - Sidewall height = 75% of 10.43 inches = 7.823 inches
    - Total diameter = 16 inches + 2 * 7.823 inches = **31.646** inches

**Difference in diameter**:
- 31.646 inches (new) - 30.602 inches (stock) = 1.044 inches
- 
Since the vehicle height change is half the difference in the tire diameter (because the tire change affects both the top and bottom of the tire equally):
**Height increase**:

- 1.044 inches / 2 = 0.522 inches

So, switching from 265/70R16 to 265/75R16 tires will increase the overall height of your Tacoma by 0.52 inches
