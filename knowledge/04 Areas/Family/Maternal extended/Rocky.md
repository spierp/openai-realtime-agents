My grandpa Rocky.

Yes there are 2 Angelo's in this picture.
Dad is the boy in the middle.
Grandpa louie had a brother Giacomo,
Giacomo had 3 kids.
Angelo is smoking a cigarette.
He has his arm around his sister Katherian.
In front of them is their sister Concetta.

Grandpa Louie's oldest sister was Giuseppa  (Josephine).
The other lady kneeling next to dad ( black and white dress)
is Giuseppa's daughter Rosie Santoro.
 
Grandpa Louie also had a sister Maria.
 The man in the military hat is her son Tony Rendi.

I would have bet money the other couple were Paternitti's,
but they say that their not. I do not know who they are yet.
But everyone else in the photo are cousins.
