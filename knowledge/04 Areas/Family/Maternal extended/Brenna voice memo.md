### Brenna's Skirt Mishap

At the wedding, Brenna wore a very short skirt. I knew that if she bent over, her backside would be visible. So, I jokingly commented to her, "I'm glad you have shorts on under that dress, like a skort." Brenna then corrected me, saying that she didn't have shorts on underneath. I was surprised and exclaimed, "Oh, my God!"

### Dancing with My Granddaughters

Later on, they invited me to dance with all four of my granddaughters: Brenna, Lauren, Caitlin, and Casey. I stood in the center while they danced around me. Naturally, everyone stopped dancing to watch us. In my mind, I thought they were all focused on the girls, especially Brenna and her provocative skirt. I knew what the guys were looking at. When we finished dancing, everyone cheered.

### Unexpected Praise

JJ's best man approached me and said, "You're my hero, no matter what anyone says." I asked him if it was because I danced with my granddaughter, to which he replied, "You're my hero." It was a funny moment. Overall, everyone was very kind to me, and I felt extremely happy and proud.

Well, there, they get me up to dance. All four of my granddaughters Brenna, Lauren, Caitlin, and Casey. And I'm in the center, and they're all dancing around me.
