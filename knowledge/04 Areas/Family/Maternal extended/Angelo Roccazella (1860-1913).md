# Angelo Roccazzella (1960-1913)
## Summary

My great-great-grandfather, Angelo Roccazella, was abandoned as an infant in 1860 at a foundling wheel in Caltagirone, Sicily—an area known for its distinctive ceramics, Baroque architecture, and long-standing charitable traditions. Records show that he was taken in and raised under the care of local institutions, including religious entities like the San Giacomo Church, which played a central role in community life, from baptisms to weddings.

As an adult, Angelo joined the Royal Italian Army, fulfilled his military service honorably, and was granted an honorable discharge in September 1883. He became literate and found his place in the community. In 1887, he married [[Concetta (Rocazella) Farruggia (1872-1931)]], who came from a local family, the Farruggias and Vaccaros, who also resided in Caltagirone. Their marriage was announced and recorded with no contest, solidifying Angelo’s new family ties and establishing his roots within the community.

Angelo and Concetta’s marriage and descendants would be intertwined with Caltagirone’s cultural, religious, and social fabric, reflecting both a personal story of perseverance and the broader heritage of 19th-century Sicily. Records and family notes also document their children and relatives—some of whom served in World War I and others who died young—creating a family narrative closely linked to the local history and the evolving Sicilian identity of the time.
