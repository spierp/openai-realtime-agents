## Patria History

With Fabre Line
Fabre Line ordered Patria and her sister ship SS Providence from Société Nouvelle des Forges et Chantiers de la Méditerranée of La Seyne-sur-Mer, near Toulon. Patria had seven decks and three funnels, but one of the funnels was a dummy. Patria had nine boilers feeding two three-cylinder triple expansion steam engines. The cylinder bores were 30.4" (high pressure), 49.36" (medium pressure) and 70.55" (low pressure), all with a stroke of 51.2". The engines gave Patria a total of 900 NHP and propelled the ship by twin screws. She carried 2,240 passengers as an immigrant ship.

Patria was launched on 11 November 1913 and entered Fabre Line service on 15 or 16 April 1914.

She plied as a transatlantic liner carrying emigrants to New York from Naples, Palermo and Marseille.
## Patria Manifest (1919)
The manifest is from the S.S. Patria, sailing from Palermo, Italy, arriving at the Port of New York on October 16, 1919.  It was likely a 10-14 day journey, and they traveled in steerage.  Conditions in steerage were often cramped, unsanitary, and uncomfortable.
There were limited facilities for hygiene, minimal privacy, and basic food provisions. Passengers often brought their own supplies to supplement meals provided by the ship.
