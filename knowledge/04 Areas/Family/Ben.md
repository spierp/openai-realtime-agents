## Ben Notes Behavioral Therapist NP
Magnesium glycinate
L-theanine 
melatonin - .5mg

taking methylphenidate HCI ER

externalization of blame.  

following through on tasks. 
non-verbal working memory. 
Struggles with spelling. 
critical of himself. 
Mostly positive. 

Piece of anxiety that is interruptive that gets in the way. when facing something difficult or challenging.

ADHD deficit of attention. challenges in social interactions, rejection sensitivity dysphoria. Apprehensions and fears. are they judging me. Wayne Duncan felt it met social anxiety disorder. 

Therapy, **cognitive behavioral therapy** focused on exposures. developing report and connection with therapist, what are the things that get fear factor up. gradual exposures to be guild his growth mindset, confident in the face of challenges. 

Moderate to severe that plus medication, typically recommend SSRI, lexipro, zolaf and prozac. when used in combination with therapy, pretty effective medications. 

A couple times a month, give some homework inbetween, probably more important than what happens in the sessions.
