Flux-Dev is the best open-source text-to-image generation model.
Replicate seems to be the most intuitive API / python library with good pricing
You can train your own custom flux-dev based LoRA on a T100 for less than $2 and then generating photos of that can range from practically nothing to 3 cents each depending on what youâ€™re doing.
