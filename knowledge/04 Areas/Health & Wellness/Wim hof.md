The following is Wim Hof speaking. 

> Witness. Without air in the lungs, you are able to stay much more than normally. Why? Because we changed your chemistry. Carbon dioxide went out, O2 went up, filled up all the cells, and the pH levels go up. Then we are able to tap into the central nervous system, and at the end we got the brainstem. And that's the place of the pineal gland, hypothalamus, pituitary gland. And the pineal gland makes the secretion of adrenaline in dangerous situations. Normally, we do not get into it because of our shallow breathing. But this is the way to get into the most primitive part, the reptilian brain, without many difficulties. And fend off bacteria, getting better into the endocrine systems. In minutes. And you're still on. That shows that the capacity to fill yourself up with oxygen is a lot more than we normally use. And as we do not use it, we are not making use of the full capacity of our physiology. Now we found out we got different layers. And we never use it. This is the way to learn to use it. To tap in and pop into the primitive brain, into the endocrine systems, immune systems, the way nature has meant it to be. Everybody is able to do it.
