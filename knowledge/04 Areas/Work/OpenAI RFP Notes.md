Talk about job walk.  Walking through a ghost town of two buildings.  Paint touch-up at 1515. 

1455 bulk of work is at lobby, floors 2-7 common areas. Terrace big scope of work.

Overseeing GOP3 and greenhouse down south. 

Overflow of consumables. 

Nobell foods doesn’t have immediate need now.

Liz,
