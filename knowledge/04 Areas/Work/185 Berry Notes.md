**Notes:**
3 levels of 185 Berry.  All of L3, part of L4, all of L5.  around 200,000sqft.  two phases.  first phase is L3 and L4 in June 1 timeframe, FDOB 7/1/205.

Do work w/o permitting.  Cosmetic refresh vs. a full tenant improvement build-out. work with existing footprint as it is. Do an overall upgrade.  Fixtures and finishes.  Phone booths, changing out finishes and partitions in restrooms.  millwork in microkitchens.  Timeline driving refresh more than the budget.  1200 seats for the site.  1500 for cafe support on L5.  952 seats on 3 and 4.  400-500 seats L5.  More of a traditional improvement project.  Desking but also event space and also a cafe kitchen seating.  two significant footprints looking at.  When L5 comes online, temporary events?

as-built reference files?  more time on site confirm understanding.  Schedule gensler to spend time on site validating.  Restrooms,gensler to review compliance.  POT and point of arrival.  can landlord provide?  Schedule is extremely fast.  make program choices now.  test fit plans now.  POT for entire building is a 6 week exercises.  Worked with 3rd parties before that do this kind of thing.  Developing the drawings in terms of as-builts.
