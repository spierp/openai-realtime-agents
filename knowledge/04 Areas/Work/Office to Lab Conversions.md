# ROM
- Wide range depending on specific project variables: $125 to $300/SF, with most in the $200+/SF range.
- Minimum feasible estimate for warm-up: $50/SF.
- Premium for new lab versus office building: $80-100/SF, excluding retrofit expenses.
## Major Considerations
### 1. Electrical Systems: $40-50/SF
- Determine if the electrical size is sufficient or if a new service is needed.  Complete re-do typically required: new service, generator, and distribution.
-  Ensure the location and operation of the generator, including fuel oil management.
### 2. HVAC Systems: $50-55/SF
- Approach to supply air: Assess if AHUs can fit on the roof or need to be on floors. Determine the number of air changes per hour (ACH) being targeted.
- New installation often necessary: new hot water and chilled water plants, airside distribution.
- Possible to salvage some office airside distribution but usually not feasible.
- General roof configuration: Ensure lab exhaust fans can fit.  Build a yard or a new roof structure to house equipment. Roof configuration to accommodate new HVAC and lab exhaust equipment.
### 3. Plumbing
- Mostly remains the same.
- Add a lab waste collection system.
- Considerations for tenant process gas rooms and other back-of-house reconfigurations.
### 4. Elevators / Loading Dock / Chemical Storage
- Addition of at least one service elevator is usually required.
- Ensure service elevators align with loading dock and path of travel.
- Designated chemical storage area required.
- Reconfiguration of back-of-house for loading dock and chemical storage rooms.
### 5. Core Framing and Structural Work
- Structural modifications for new shafts.  Significant work needed for larger shafts.
- Upgrades might be needed to address vibration concerns.  Floor stiffening for MIPs criteria.  Address potential LL of the structure if aggressively designed for office use.
- Steel buildings MIPS performance typically easier to improve than concrete ones.
- Ensure sufficient load-bearing capacity for bench work.
## Additional Considerations
- Adequate floor-to-floor height (developer spec buildings are going 16'-0" and higher).
- Knock-on architectural and structural scopes for most of the above modifications.
