Title: Director of Preconstruction and Innovation

Regional Manager: After further reflection I’m aligned with dropping the ‘regional manager’ title, I can keep the business cards, and should the right opportunities arise, we can jump on it.  That said, you mentioned one thing that caused me to pause, something not in these exact words but to the effect of “if you were pushing for Seattle growth, then I would be pushing/working to get you resources to make that successful”. I had taken it as a forgone conclusion that dedicating any real time or energy to Seattle was not palatable. I get the sense that is true for at least the next year or two, but perhaps after that, there is an opportunity to reopen that discussion? I don’t want to close the door on the concept of having a real presence up here. 

“Innovation” vs “technology”: I want to draw a line very clearly between Jason’s domain and my proposed role.  Our existing “Director of Information Technology” role primarily focuses on managing, maintaining, and optimizing our existing IT infrastructure, including hardware, software, data management, vendor relationships, and technology costs. In contrast, my proposed “innovation” role emphasizes strategic creativity, proactive exploration, and adoption of emerging technologies specifically to enhance core business operations, streamline processes, and drive transformative companywide improvements. Rather than managing our technology backbone, this new role will lead operational innovation initiatives to secure our competitive advantage and deliver measurable efficiency improvements across the organization.
