### Aptitude
- Integrated model-based approach to interiors and renovations
- Bidpackage distribution platform.  Tried to get us to go to market.  Building Connected CEO and founder admired my product, he invited me to lunch with his CTO, etc...  BC was acquired by Autodesk for $275M a couple years later.  
- Internal database for special projects.  
- Developed bid leveling platform connected to buildingconnected bid forms.
- Developed industry leading estimating platform (presented in-person to Autodesk team this summer).  Described as "phenomenal"
- Developing AI tools.  Presented to Trimble. Described as "incredible" particularly given my lack of training in software.  
### Value / ROI
- As I think about how can I maximize my contributions and value to the company, I am getting less convinced that regional expansion is the clear answer.  There are a lot of folks within Hathaway Dinwiddie that could make great regional managers.  I would classify a lot of our project operations efforts as mostly procedural in nature.  In procedural work, the best people are 2x better than the average.  However, in creative/inventive work, the best people are 10x better than average.  This isn't to diminish the importance of procedural work, it is our foundation, the point is the broader spectrum of performance between procedural vs. creative output, and therefore the strategic importance of capitalizing on creative top performers where possible.  
- While I have proven I can manage a project successfully, JPMorgan and 180 Montgomery projects long ago, or recently the Westin Seattle, I don't view it as my standout strength or any area where I surpass other colleagues.  Business development and networking are not a core strength of mine compared to others, either. I can do it, but I am not drawn to it.  If am being completely honest with you and myself, in these areas I'm whipped forward by a desire to please others and a feeling of duty.  However, I have demonstrated technology as a natural passion.  My track record with applied technology did not come from a job description, a mandate, a team effort, a company goal or concerted idea, or a feeling of duty or desire to appease anyone. Every time it was just me riffing in my spare time, tilling the soil, living the value "if you can make it better, make it so".  That's my natural talent and ambition.  I'm not being whipped forward, there's a magnet that I'm drawn to.
- Given focus and agency in this area, I believe I could elevate our performance and add more value than in the roles I serve today.  A lot of people in our business and at our company talk a lot.  I don't spend time selling myself or my work.  But if I made an effort in that regard, I believe I could craft a compelling story around consistent passion and knack for excelling in the tech sphere over my career.  In procedural work, I'm a dependable JV back-up quarterback.  In the often creative, inventive, open-ended challenges surrounding the application of technology, I believe I could play primetime on Sunday with the best performers in our industry.  If you think it would be useful to craft that story as part of this proposal, I can spend some time on it.  
- For these reasons, I feel a desire to lead the integration of technology within Hathaway Dinwiddie's operational processes, ensuring competitive advantage, enhanced performance, and added value for clients.  This desire comes from genuine belief that it is the best use of my talents for the company as well as for my own career growth and job satisfaction.  

### Intro

Hi Kevin,

Following up on our conversation, see below for some thoughts around what a technology focused leadership role could look like.  

This doesn't cover the "why me" portion.  A lot of people in our business and at our company talk a lot.  I don't spend time selling myself or my work, probably to a fault in some instances and I am trying to be my own advocate more.  But in short, in the often creative, inventive, open-ended challenges surrounding the application of technology, I believe I have demonstrated ability to play primetime on Sunday with the best in our industry.  This aptitude isn't just about capitalizing on the latest thing, it requires a discerning eye for the practical realities of our operations (i.e., where technology is the right choice versus where a back-to-basics approach is more effective). If you think it would be useful to craft the story around my aptitude and qualifications as part of this proposal, I can put some effort into it.

I can envision a scenario where I'm serving as our technology lead as well as the regional manger of Seattle simultaneously, and do both effectively, assuming we can scale up project team resources commensurate with demand in Seattle. Staying connected with operations would also anchor my tech leadership in real-world on-the-ground reality.

### Role
- Vice President of Technology
	- Mission: To lead the integration of technology within Hathaway Dinwiddie's operations, ensuring competitive advantage, enhanced performance, and added value for our clients.
	- The job title itself isn't important to me. What matters is the bandwidth to focus and the agency/authority within our organization to engage broadly and impact change.  "Director of Technology" could work, but it would be very similar and confusing between Jason and me in terms of title.  More on that subject later...
- Reporting Structure
	- As a companywide leadership role, it would be logical to report to John Cowles as COO in the same way Leo, Jesse, or Ted report to him today.  However, as regional manager of Seattle, it makes sense to continue to report through you in the same way Silicon Valley does today.  Obviously I like working for you and have had success and job satisfaction under your guidance over the years.  John is less of a known quantity, but it would be good to establish a rapport with him.  I can see pros/cons to both scenarios and don't have a strong opinion either way.        
- Key Responsibilities
	- Strategic Technological Leadership:
		- Stay up-to-date with emerging technologies in the construction industry and evaluate their applicability to Hathaway Dinwiddie.
		- Compile and maintain a comprehensive log of technology solutions across all facets of operations, capturing its key functionality, competitors, cost, level of industry adoption, practical challenges, and internal recommendations or use cases.
		- Collaborate with the executive team to ensure that our tech vision aligns with the overall company strategy. This would include updates/discussion at management meetings and other relevant forums.  
		- Serve as our internal subject matter expert for general precon/construction/field technology and a resource to answer questions from staff.  Host a weekly session for people to ask questions, seek advice or help, etc.  
	- Operational Technology Application:
		- Advocate for discernment over dazzle.  Help our organization resist the temptation to grab the latest magic bright shiny object, and carefully determine the areas where new technology is the right choice and other areas where a back-to-basics management approach is more effective. 
		- Identify areas within precon/construction processes that can be improved through technology.  Engage with teams to identify current bottlenecks, pinch points, or areas of weakness that technology might play a role in solving.
		- Oversee the development and deployment of in-house tools and 3rd party solutions to improve operational efficiency and performance.
	- Collaboration & Partnership:
		- Collaborate with MIS to ensure that new technologies are supported and seamlessly integrated into our tech stack.
		- Form partnerships with technology providers and institutions that can offer solutions or insights.  For example, engage more directly with Stanford construction research programs like CIFE.  (These endeavors often pivot into business development avenues.)
		- Facilitate inter-departmental communication between regions to ensure all teams are tech-enabled and trained.  Identify, document, and enforce where alignment is in our best interest, and where teams having freedom/discretion to select the tools they deem fit is more advantageous strategically. 
	- Continuous Learning & Training:
		- Develop and host training programs to upskill employees in new technologies.
		- Create a culture of continuous technological learning and innovation within the company.  
		- Establish a newsletter or similar periodic report (or shoehorn into an existing program) to keep people up-to-date and engaged. 
	- ROI & Value Analysis:
		- Regularly assess the ROI of existing tech implementations to ensure they add value to the company's processes combining both quantitative and qualitative evaluations.
			- Baseline measurement.  Before tech solution is implemented, record performance metrics such as completion time, error rates, manpower usage, etc.  After implementing tech, compare new metrics to the baseline.
			- Account for all costs related to implementation.  Initial investment, training, ongoing maintenance, licenses, support/customization etc..
			- Beyond quantification, document any improvements in service or quality.
			- Survey users of technology and their insights beyond immediate quantitative metrics, such as ease of use, satisfaction, and reduced frustration.  
			- Use software analytics to monitor how often tech is being used.
			- Consider non-quantifiable benefits like improved brand image, better compliance and security, increased employee morale, or enhanced customer satisfaction.
			- Set periodic review cycles (e.g., annually) to assess ROI. This ensures that the tech's value proposition is continually aligned with the company's evolving goals and needs.
			- Establish a mechanism for continuous feedback. Encourage teams to provide insights about potential improvements or new tools that could enhance ROI.
		- Present technology integration ROI and value analysis, achievements, challenges, and future plans to the executive team at management meetings or other relevant forums.  
	- External Communication:
		- Serve as a liaison (with Jason) for technology providers and vendors.
		- Communicate the company's technological vision and achievements to clients, design consultants, and others in our industry, ensuring they recognize the added value of working with a tech-forward contractor.  (Participation in interviews, BD meetings, industry events, conferences, etc...)
		- Develop and maintain technology related content for use in proposals and RFP responses.  
		- Develop and maintain technology related content for use in website, social media, advertisements, and other externally facing media.
- Required Skills & Qualities:
	- Strong understanding of the construction industry, Hathaway Dinwiddie operations, and broader technology trends.  Includes document control, cost control, estimating, scheduling, and field work. (field is one area I would need to focus on improving my competency).
	- General "where-with-all" holistic understanding of software and hardware foundations and ability to traverse various domains with subject matter experts such as:
		- Databases (e.g., MySQL), programming languages (e.g., Python, JavaScript, Ruby), and web/API technologies (e.g., JSON, HTML, CSS), and frameworks such as Ruby-on-Rails, Bootstrap, Flask, etc...
		- Understanding of key software paradigms like RESTful architecture and object-oriented programming.
		- Proficiency in version control systems, particularly Git, and familiarity with cloud platforms like Azure and AWS.
		- A foundational knowledge of computer architecture, (CPU vs GPU vs RAM vs HD etc.), and an awareness of network protocols (e.g., TCP/IP, HTTP) and topologies.
	- Leadership and team management abilities.
	- Analytical skills to evaluate the efficacy of technology implementations.
	- Excellent communication skills.
	- Passion for innovation and continuous improvement.

- While this role might be politically threatening to Jason, I see a distinct difference between his trajectory and the path I'm envisioning. I'm not aspiring to be the CIO. Rather than focusing on the management of the company's IT infrastructure, my interest lies in harnessing tech solutions to enhance our operations. The traditional responsibilities of a CIO or Director of IT encompass tech infrastructure, security, and software deployment, among other things. The role I'm suggesting zeroes in on applying technology to refine our precon and construction processes and streamline operations.  While Jason might see himself as occupying both roles, I would argue that he is great at the management of our IT infrastructure and lacking in his ability to sift through the endless tech possibilities and pick the right horses to hitch our operational wagons to.  
### Competitor roles:
