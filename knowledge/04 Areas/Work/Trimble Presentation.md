First example I want to show you is with unstructured data.  
Here I dropped some PDFs in a folder called trimble.  
These are a series of quick start guides for project teams to read up on related to specific trades or scopes of work.  I've also dropped a word file into this folder with our core ideology. 

Now here's the chatbot we have created.  I can ask "what is our mission statement and core ideology?"

Behind the scenes we are using a framework called FAISS for the AI to search the text, and then this information is included in the prompt to the AI chat model.

Here I will ask about what are some important things to know about "mass timber construction and CLT.  specifically, are there any lessons learned?"

**"THAT WHICH IS MEASURED IS MANAGED"**
