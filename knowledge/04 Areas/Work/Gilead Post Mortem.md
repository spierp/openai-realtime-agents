- Should have flown down and been there in person from time to time
- Cameras should be on be default.  Brent in one meeting said he stopped addressing people or even considering them part of the meeting until their camera was on. Basically the only excuse is if you're driving.  
- Should be in one template.  Approach worked on SMU
- Should publish conditional formatted trade level variance at each milestone.  Omitted "for sake of brevity".

- Maurice was outgunned on MEP.  Lack of lab interiors experience showed.  
- Flood Darius with information.  With the waterfall, we had backup, but we omitted it.  On decision log items, we often had backup, but it was not shared until the item was formalized.  
- Bump out ROM might have been the straw that broke the camels back from a trust perspective.  

#### Pros
Project team was appropriate.
TVD Log was good.
Great quality subcontract pool.
Large team, picking lanes and somewhat sticking to them?  Stepping on toes?  
#### Hindsights
- Widget / TVD Log
- same page with architect on future job.  if numbers are going to be presented.  
- GRs and GCs that increases that showed up in the estimates and the waterfall.  
- More transparency
- More pitfalls.  


#### Cons
Roles were not clear?  
Gensler +TBD

Gilead hindsight Items
- Bring TVD Dashboard forward to new projects
- Bring "widget" into conceptual estimates to illustrate range of outcomes on a system by system basis.
- Standardize onto one estimate template
- Publish trade level variance at each milestone with conditional formatting and comments
- Cameras on in meetings, be enthusiastic and engaged, by there in person when possible
- Provide more back-up and detail to those that crave data
