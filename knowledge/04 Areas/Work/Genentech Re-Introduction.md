## Prompt
"2-minute introduction of yourself. Include your tenure with the company, your tenure in the industry. your current role, and - here's the kicker - your _craft_. What do you view as your _craft_ or _work-product_ that you endeavor to mole and shape and tune throughout your career. What about your craft inspires you and motivates you."

## Introduction
Peter Spier, precon manager, 17yrs Hathaway Dinwiddie. During that time focused almost entirely on interiors and renovations in the bay area.  I've worked closely on the vast majority of our life science interior build-outs in the area in recent history.  The most relevant to something similar to Genentech would be the Amgen headquarters in South San Francisco on which I was the precon manager, but I also led the estimating effort on a handful of significant life science TIs in South San Francisco over the last few years.  


## Craft
My craft is focused around helping project teams make decisions earlier in the design process.  We all intuitively understand how the cost of design related changes goes up dramatically as the design progresses.  I'm focused on developing and utilizing using a variety of tools and tactics including BIM, proprietary software, market feedback, data science, and intuitive reporting/communication along side practices like target value design to help drive early decision making.  I believe the success of a project can be measured by the quality of preconstruction, this is what gets me up in the morning.  Lately in life science interiors that is all about lab flexibility, researching the trade-offs for varying levels of flexibility in the lab environment.

	- six floors within The Cove at Oyster Point. Interior construction included biology and chemistry labs, support areas, vivarium, conference rooms, break room, new communication stairways, process equipment at roof and process piping to nitrogen storage area on first floor. 
- MyoKardia TI (Bristol Myers Squibb)
	- DGA / 160,000 / $35M
	- vivarium, biology labs, chemistry labs, tissue culture labs, and a feature 3-floor open communication stair.


## Technology
- Navisworks for clash detection, began in earnest in 2011 w/ Cedars Sinai advanced health sciences pavilion. But our model based coordination technically goes back to USC in 1999.  
- Procore in 2015 for cloud based document.
- In terms of reality capture in the field we participated in Openspace's early beta pilot program in 2016, still using their product today.  Also use site aware on select projects an additional level of sophistication in terms of quantifying work in place, tracking field observations 
- Also we're using SmartPM for schedule analytics. Ensuring industry best practices are met with our scheduling logic.    

## Spirit of Innovation

Core values, make it better, make it.  Culture of constantly looking for improvement.  

See AI as a big opportunity right now would say industry leading in terms of our capabilities.  Private instance of GPT-4 deployed to our corporate cloud on azure our first proof of concept with this we are calling kind of tongue-in-cheek chatHDC.  It's a simple chatbot for project information search document retrieval.  Screenshot of me presenting this at the Trimble Dimensions conference last November.
