## SEATTLE LIFE SCIENCES PULSE CHECK: MARKET DEMAND AND TRENDS
![[Pasted image 20240530090625.png]]

- 14% vacancy today vs 7-8% in 2016.  Location is more important than before. 
- 150,000 sqft available in u-district.  
- Exciting innovations.  
	- Change in terms of cancer research, celgene therapy, targeted therapies
	- automation within lab.
	- robotics
	- Pilot plants in-house? Kicking off manufacturing locally.  
	- Seattle IS the AI biologics capital of the world. David Baker.  The most exciting protein in the world. The only lab competing with him is all of deep mind at google. - Ken Horenstein Founder/Partner w/ Pack Ventures. Rosetta fold or alpha fold. (14min)

	- https://time.com/6969322/david-baker/
- In vitro vs in silica data? $8-$10M? Alexandria coworking space.  
- 3 VCs who write checks at pre-seed round in Seattle.  need 10 or 20.
- 10-7 or 5-3M in funding.  Dollars in vs valuation. 
- Convergence of AI and biology is hot.  Dual antagonist. Multi-model multi antagonist to 18. Cell therapy has backed off. 
- DGFR? CNS unsolved? 
- Slight uptick in VC beginning of the year. Understanding new normal
- Convergence. How much more capital efficient they are. 
- (25 minutes)
- More need for smaller tenant space. 
- 40/60 office to wet lab.
- More dry space in labs. 
- Fight for talent. Access to views / nature. amenity/gym/conf center. More access to views and colors. 
- Not seeing a decrease in wet lab space. AI is allowing them to lab work faster. Need for wet lab space. 
- Emergence of incubator spaces. CoLab, CoMotion. Incubators
- Attracting talent biggest problem. Param water accessibility?
- Slow growth unless NSF funding increasing. Federal funding? 
- Getting to new normal. stable financial condition. 
- Housing affordability. Housing in Seattle is ridiculous, way too unaffordable to attract talent.  Embrace incentivizing entrepuership. 
- If you built and you hire people here, give you 250k to stay here, like they do in Canada. How do we incentivize small business. 

## SHAPING SEATTLE'S LIFE SCIENCES LANDSCAPE: DEVELOPING LABS FOR DIVERSE TENANT NEEDS
![[Pasted image 20240530090722.png]]
- valuations way down
- 428 Westlake originally a lab building.
- Top 5 life science market. Been confirmed over last 5 years. 
- Pipeline of researchers coming out of UW. 
- Occupancy rates are down. 
- 12-15 months, long term fundamentals are positive in Seattle
- Sensitivity to proximity. Really value location. 
- Speed to market. 4-5 year bet.
- 2-3 year timeframe outside of box thinking relatively smaller firms be most of the customers. 
- Nobu inspired spa amenity, onsen, cold and hot water therapy. Treatment rooms?
- A lot of spec labs on the market right now.
- Adapt spaces in future and address different needs.
- Computational power available, a lot from 2000s
- Westlake Consulting Group.
	- Automation labs can be very sensitive equipment. MIP resistance required. 
	- 5-10% for future space
- VRF system needs a certain amount of load in order to function. Go hydronic on HVAC.
- This region knows how to build stuff. 
- We can't stay at 5.25% interest rates, 18-24 months until things fall apart. 
- When interest rates come back down opportunities will shake loose relatively quickly. 80-90% down, huge opportunity for people to acquire existing building. $1,000-$1,600sqft. buy an existing for $200/sqft.
- Manufacturing spaces, "high-bay" more demands on loading space. LN2 tank storage cost of those are more unique demands. 
- 


## POWER OF PARTNERSHIP: TRANSFORMING SEATTLE INTO A LIFE SCIENCES POWERHOUSE
![[Pasted image 20240530090850.png]]
- non-profit ressearch institutes. fred hutch, allen foundation, VRI
- Marc trade association. WA state does fund and support Ann Hills care fund. 
- Affordable spacing, as a public entity can't provide them with VC funding. 
- Alrich & Associates - contractor hyper local?
- I'm tired of being the only one in the room. Need diversity, lose college kids, because we don't do equity and diversity. Biochemist. 
- Innovation Distrct, W27 Building Portage Bay Crossing.
- expose students to bio tech. Not just phizer or Seagen. Not just PHDs, folks all across economic continuum.
- UW is the number one university in research? Tacoma and Bothell campuses. 
- Incentive bonus for organizations to stay here - Canada.
- Crisis w/ opioids. 
- Continue to invest in communities, more suburban communities?
- Get kids back into system.
- More advocates in those areas outside Seattle. Bothell, Shoreline, Vancouver,
- $1B hydrogen hub. why can't we do that with life sciences?
- Get money from feds.  80 life science companies in Bothell. 
- Maritime Glue. Aging group that cannot find youth to come in. What is to get into that industry.  Trying to get into trades with workforce development. 
- Kids want to work at desk. 
- A New - women lead organization letting kids know about trades. Looking at crisis if we don't get more people into construction trades.
- What's importance of collaboration between public and private sector? 
- Urban Renaissance Group back up here? 


## CRAFTING TOMORROW'S INNOVATION SPACES: CREATING SUSTAINABLE AND ADAPTABLE ENVIRONMENTS.
![[Pasted image 20240530090930.png]]
- flexibility. Utilization, since covid using space differently and needs to be measured. 90% staff would show up. Even bench researchers don't show up every day: 60-70%.  Flad is helping with. How many people are in the lab at any given time.  Shockingly low compared to price of facility. Co-working environment with shared environment. 
- Working at wet bench for two weeks, then not come in for four weeks.
- Back in the day you would toil for days at the bench.  Now you put an experiment watch for a few weeks.
- Utility bill, smart enough to react to users, off ramps to modify to reduce, limits dollars for research. 
- Running 100% outside-air with 10-15 changes per hour. 300k per month. 
- Unknown lab/office ratio before tenant demands known. 
- Building tune-up requirements. Childrens has BSL3 vivarium. 
- Baseline is Seattle code for sustainability. Looking at ways to reduce energy consumption. Occupancy sensors so dial systems back. recycling programs. A lot of consumables. 
- Nothing is free.  Using more PPE than ever before. ALl of waste going into landfill. Partnered to see if could recycle gloves, masks, pipe tips, green plastics. 
- Compost all of our animal bedding. Find ways to turn stuff off smartly. 
- Load requirements of operating mass specs is high. 
- neutralization tank under each sink? whole building system much better.
- Vacuum waste bedding system to loading dock. Pressure to do better is good. 
- Water based systems, heating cooling chilled water systems, fan coils, chilled beams, stay hydronic water based system. Won't be banned like refrigerants can be. 
- Waste heat from building, cross property lines when we talk about thermal. share between buildings. Why not high efficiency thermal, Seattle childrens has a lot of waste heat that could be used by the neighborhood. Water is the medium for us to be flexible. 
- Hoteling at the bench, figured out how to do it in the office space, should be possible in the labs. 
- 100% wireless. we put in wired infrastructure for data. a lot of money in cabling and infrastructure that goes with it. 
- transparency between faculty, admin, president, 
- CoMotion. reduce cost of construction.  
- Flad shout out from seattle childrens.
