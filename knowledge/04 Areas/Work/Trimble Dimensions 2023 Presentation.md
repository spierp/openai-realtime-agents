### Outline
Problem Statement:
As a construction company we all have data scattered in different places. from databases to excel to word files and PDFs. For us we have procore, viewpoint, deltek. 
Using this data requires navigating through multiple layers of interfaces
which can be time consuming and impractical for most employees
inefficiency and expertise required.

Goal:
build a companywide AI chatbot for efficient information retrieval (search)
minimize the digital distance, or steps and expertise needed for data access.

Rules:
- All data within the chatbot should be accessible by everyone within our organization.  This is for a few reasons:
		- Democratize the information that we agree should be accessible to every employee within our company.
		- to keep sensitive data secure as we experiment with new technology
		- Minimizes complexity of development.  
- Chatbot needs to be accessible both on desktop as well as mobile devices.  
- Chatbot needs to run on our own infrastructure. have our chat model deployed to Azure, stays within our environment.  making sure data is secure.

Show you are working prototype.  Our goal is to have this up and running across the company by the end of the year.
