### Health Predisposition Reports (13+ reports available)

Genetic factors that may influence your chances of developing certain health conditions. Consider talking to a healthcare professional if you have a personal or family history of one of these conditions or have concerns about your results.

Our reports do not include all possible genetic variants that could affect these conditions. Other factors can also affect your risk of developing these conditions, including lifestyle, environment, and family history.

### Carrier Status Reports (44+ reports available)

Learn whether you have specific genetic variants that may not affect your health, but could affect your children's health. Consider talking to a healthcare professional before making any major lifestyle changes or if you have any concerns about your results.

If you see "Variant not detected" for a Carrier Status report, it means you're not a carrier of the tested variant(s). Keep in mind that while our Carrier Status reports cover many variants, they don't include all possible variants associated with each condition. So it's still possible to be a carrier of a variant not included in our test.

| **Condition**                                                   | **Result**             |
