# An important truth few people agree with

### Crypto provides the rails for an internet of value revolution that will reshape the world more dramatically than the original internet itself

### Background

The FTX meltdown is shining light on the crypto industry, and it's not surprising that many people I talk to today are skeptical, uninterested, or outspoken critics of crypto. I don't blame them. Between the Superbowl ads, sports stadium naming and other gratuitous spending, press that highlights nothing but scams, environmental concerns, folks losing their life savings or getting rich overnight, and now the FTX fraud, what's left to like? A [recent CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/12/07/just-8percent-of-americans-have-a-positive-view-of-cryptocurrencies-now-cnbc-survey-finds.html) poll suggests only 8% of Americans have a positive view of cryptocurrencies.

Unfortunately, the onslaught of bad optics is masking technology that I believe will be a massive force for good in the decades to come. Let’s dig in…

### Thesis

"What important truth do very few people agree with you on?" My answer today:

**The internet is one of humanity's greatest technological achievements, and blockchain technology provides the rails for an internet of value revolution that will eventually disrupt and reshape the world more dramatically than the original internet itself. The fundamental value proposition of blockchains is internet native scarcity. It's difficult to fully conceptualize and articulate the scope of what this unlocks, but it often keeps me up at night and may well eventually reorder the entire world financial and banking system, nation-state governance, taxation, social services, and social coordination, financial coordination (corporations), commerce, sports, and entertainment, and on and on. That reordering will be inherently more transparent and fair than the systems we live with today.**

Ok, I sound like a tinfoil hat madman? Why I believe this statement to be true:

- Blockchains introduce protocols for an internet and **democratization of value** in the same way TCP/IP protocols democratized information and underpin the open internet today. They are a fundamentally new kind of computer because they make lasting commitments and provide credibly neutral scarcity in the digital world for the first time. They don’t solve any computer science problems, which is why a lot of CSE types roll their eyes, instead they solve a human coordination problem that requires people to zoom out and look at a variety of disciplines from first principles.
- Prior to blockchains, all digital records of anything of value, from your Fortnite skin, to your amazon shopping history, your friend list on Instagram, the deed to your home, the money in your retirement account, your Facebook profile, and your ticket to the Packers game, are stored on siloed corporate or government databases. None of these datasets are interconnected, other than centrally tractable and proprietary APIs and front-ends. As a result, there is no digitally native value, value on these ledgers is instead ascribed by trusted third parties (corporations are custodians of the data)
- Over the next few decades, we will live through the only time in human history where this siloed information living in unlinked and disjointed corporate databases will begin migration to databases that are public goods owned and controlled by everyone. Plenty of issues around security and privacy still need to be addressed, but this is the promise of cryptography and the path forward for the betterment of humanity. It won’t happen overnight and may take much longer than I expect, but I do believe it is an inevitable evolutionary step forward.
- Why should anyone care about this change? Aren’t you just unnecessarily applying the natural laws of scarcity in the physical world to a digital world of abundance that doesn’t have the same inherent limitations? Won’t scarcity let unfettered capitalism into the digital world unnecessarily, causing further inequality and suffering? These are great questions, but I would argue that our universe is meaningless without scarcity. Why am I moved by the Beatles classic _Two of Us_ when Paul Sings “You and I have memories longer than the road that stretches out ahead.” Imagine everyone living forever with infinite resources in an endless world, experiencing everything with everyone always. That world is utterly pointless. **The scarcity of time is what gives time its meaning.** If we all have infinite time, even the most valuable thing in the universe becomes meaningless to us. Of course, this isn’t to suggest when you apply scarcity that anything will be as valuable as time, it just means that with endless abundance, no person, experience, or action, will be special, unique, or worth remembering. This is the reality of most digital things today. People hear “scarcity” and they think of food shortages or limited access to healthcare, but those things aren’t relevant in the digital world. I wish they would instead associate digital scarcity with what makes things special, authentic, unique, or meaningful.
- **A digital world with meaning isn’t an escape from reality, it is** _**more**_ **reality**. Expanding reality means new green fields of economic opportunity, **opportunities that exist beyond the credentialism, gatekeeping, privilege, and geographic limitations of the physical world**. There is a huge opportunity gap between haves and have-nots that gets significantly reduced when building meaningful experiences and commerce in the digital world. Talk to any digital artist that can now for the first time make a living wage and support their family by selling their art through the scarcity of NFTs. There is already a not insignificant number of such artists. Parts of this bright future are already here, it’s just very early and in primitive forms. **Money is just one app built on the protocol of meaning enabled by blockchains.** It gets the most attention because it is the most developed and the easiest app to build, but there is a whole universe of other rabbit holes blockchains unlock (and more interesting IMO).
- I like the phrase “optimists shall inherit the earth”. In other words, while critics and skeptics are occupied with highlighting problems, the optimists are out there taking risks and building because they believe the future is bright, so the future will belong to them. Future generations won’t be subject to a global reserve currency controlled by a black box of unelected elites from a geographically defined nation-state empire. Money will be a global, permissionless, digital currency, because it is a more fair, open, trustworthy, and free system for the global population. This will be a hard-fought battle. Strategically, the US dollar is the Country’s most important export for maintaining global power, and it isn’t backed by anything other than guns and strategic alliances. Skeptics have told me the concept of a global digital currency is too idealistic, and counter-culture computer geeks don’t control the men with guns, but as an optimist, I believe game theory just needs time to play out. In the end, the truth wins.
- So before you buy into Jamie Dimon’s lazy “ponzi/scam” argument, consider that most things in life only have value because society collectively agrees there is value. Whether it’s US dollars, the Mona Lisa, football, the Nobel Prize, or the deed to your home, its value isn’t backed by anything other than social structures. The “ponzi” critique is high school debate level logic and fairly easily debunked for anyone with a moderately open mind and willingness to think about it for a minute.
- Bernie Madoff was a scammer, just like Enron executives, and now the founder of the crypto exchange FTX, which was just another bank that defrauded customers and happened to be stealing their crypto. **Con artists scamming people is a tale as old as time.** These instances only illustrate why we need real crypto, the decentralized, permissionless, fair, the publicly auditable kind now more than ever. The purpose of money crypto is to remove the gatekeepers and middlemen from the financial system so they can’t perpetrate fraud.

## Not Financial Advice

I’m not calling any top or bottom of any cryptocurrency, I don’t know when to buy or sell, I’m not a trader, and I’m not interested in market speculation or short term price movements. However, I am deeply invested in crypto and web3’s fundamental value proposition, and naturally have high conviction long term bets in this space that I am willing to be wrong about. You can lose what you put in, always do your own research. With risk and uncertainty comes opportunity, but please know what you are getting into. Most tokens are worthless garbage, in my opinion there is only a small handful worth paying attention to.

## Blockchain Overview

##### _If you already understand blockchain basics please feel free to skip ahead, this is meant to be an "explain it to me like I'm five" overview of how crypto works._

#### Decentralized Ledgers

blockchains such as bitcoin, are basically an accounting ledger, in the same way your checking account with your bank is an accounting ledger of debts and credits to the dollar value in your account. What makes this blockchain ledger different than the one with your Wells Fargo account, is a blockchain ledger is distributed across thousands of computers across the world, there is no central authority, it doesn't require trust, and if properly decentralized, it is a digital organism that cannot lie and cannot be turned off, in the same way nobody can turn off the internet today.

#### Consensus

Blockchains achieve this decentralization through a distributed consensus mechanism. Distributed consensus is the core piece of innovation that blockchains provide, and while it can be technically complex, it can also be simplified.

I will focus on the proof-of-stake form of consensus used by Ethereum, since that is the environmentally friendly option today and in my opinion also the most capital efficient.

Imagine a group of people sitting around a table, each with 10 poker chips. At the beginning of a block, or round, if a person wants to help validate the transactions at the table, they push 3 chips into the center, and are called a “validator”. All these validators then watch as all folks around the table engage in commerce, trading their chips for goods and services, etc... after a set number of trades, they reach the end of the block, or round, and all of the validators that have been watching the commerce write their observations on a piece of paper and push them to the center of the table. _Jane sent Bob 2 chips, Bob sent Maurice 1 chip, etc..._ As a group, the validators review the recorded observations together. If a validator reports transactions that are consistent with more than half the other validators, they earn an extra chip as payment for their services of validating the transactions. if their report of the transactions conflicts with most of the validators, they lose the 3 chips they put in.

Basically, the validators are all financially incentivized to tell the truth, they are rewarded for being honest, and punished for being dishonest.

In this group-at-a-table analogy, it is easy to imagine collusion, where a few folks get together and lie about the transactions for their mutual benefit. This is called a 51% attack, where a single group or individual owns and controls 51% of the validators and cooks the books. But at scale, in a properly decentralized system with thousands of validators across the globe, where each validator needs substantial capital to participate, and where flows of capital are publicly traceable, it becomes technically possible but practically unlikely for this to occur. There is also social coordination level defense against this type of attack that we don't need to get into here.

### Trust-minimized Credible Neutrality

Assuming a blockchain is sufficiently decentralized through this consensus mechanism, it can be considered trustless, credibly neutral, and censorship-resistant.

In other words, people across the world can agree on very little, but nobody will argue with the amount of ether in an Ethereum wallet. It doesn’t matter if you are Greta Thunberg, Kim Jong-un, or Kim Dot Com, there are no differences of opinion because the blockchain doesn't take sides and isn't susceptible to manipulation and corruption in the same way centralized authority is.

## Ownership in General

### Capitalism and its shortcomings

A quick aside on human nature, if you don't see how even the most selfless humanitarians (Mother Theresa, Nelson Mandela, Mahatma Gandhi, etc…) operated in their own self-interest, the book [Awareness](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/94318.Awareness) by the Indian Jesuit priest and quasi Buddhist, Anthony de Mello, provides some explanation. He argues there are three types of selfishness (quoted):

1. First, when I do something, or rather, when I give myself the pleasure of pleasing myself; quite unrefined.
2. Second, when I give myself the pleasure of pleasing others. Don’t take pride in that. Don’t think you’re a great person. You’re a very ordinary person, but you’ve got refined tastes. When you were a child, you liked Coca-Cola; now you’ve grown older and you appreciate cold beer on a hot day. You’ve got better tastes. But you’re getting your pleasure all the same, except now it’s in the pleasure of pleasing others.
3. Then you’ve got the third type, which is the worst: when you do something good to avoid the guilt of not doing it. The good deed doesn’t give you a good feeling, you hate it. You’re making loving sacrifices but you’re grumbling. How little you truly know yourself if you think you don’t do things this way as well.

Humans are the most refined animals. We've gotten to types 2 and 3 of selfishness, whereas all other animals are stuck with the first type.

Because of the inherent self-interested nature of all living things, fundamentally an evolutionary drive to survive and thrive, while flawed, I believe capitalism is aligned with the motivations of the natural world. However, capitalism today is broken and needs reform.

Looking at history, Ray Dalio notes in his [essay on the needed reform of capitalism](https://corpgov.law.harvard.edu/2020/10/13/why-and-how-capitalism-needs-to-be-reformed/):

> The communist philosophy of “from each according to his ability, to each according to his needs” turned out to be naïve because people were not motivated to work hard if they didn’t get commensurately rewarded, so prosperity suffered. Capitalism, which connects pay to productivity and creates efficient capital markets that facilitate savings and the availability of buying power to fuel people’s productivity, worked much better.

But today, capitalism is broken, and it’s not the result of evil rich people or lazy poor people. Dalio argues:

> all good things taken to an extreme become self-destructive and everything must evolve or die, and these principles now apply to capitalism. While the pursuit of profit is usually an effective motivator and resource allocator for creating productivity and for providing those who are productive with buying power, it is now producing a self-reinforcing feedback loop that **widens the income/wealth/opportunity gap** to the point that capitalism and the American Dream are in jeopardy. That is because **capitalism is now working in a way in which people and companies find it profitable to have policies and make technologies that lessen their people costs, which lessens a large percentage of the population’s share of society’s resources.**

It's in vogue to shit on capitalism today, and the growing income-wealth opportunity gap is a legitimate criticism. A lot of academics and intellectuals are made uncomfortable by money. The argument is that ideas should win, and money is a corrupting influence over ideas.

I would argue that concentration of power corrupts, and that crypto will eventually democratize capital (capital = power) in the same way the internet democratized information. It is an inherently more free, open, and fair system than the financial stack we live with today. This is because the crypto’s value proposition is providing financial services and internet native value as a public good available to everyone on earth regardless of their background.

In the long run, the truth wins. systems that people use in their daily lives to make themselves and their families better off will be adopted because it aligns with the inherent incentives of the natural world. And crypto can reform and improve capitalism by realigning incentives and distribution of power, bending it towards the individual and communities, instead of corrupt governments and corporations, so it will be adopted. We are already seeing web3 reinventing internet services which are owned and operated by communities instead of companies. See [nouns](https://nouns.wtf/) DAO, for example.

### Digital Ownership

Clear title to land, knowing it wasn't going to be arbitrarily taken away from you by some lord or nation, was a major economic turning point for modern civilization. When you own land, you have incentive and motivation to improve it. You can also borrow against it, which made business possible, unlocking capital by borrowing.

Blockchains provide clear title to property rights in the digital world for the first time. No corporation has control over your digital property, in the same way you have control over your physical property in the real world.

We already know what the web looks like without ownership. It’s the feudal system controlled by a small number of goliath corporate platforms we know today. Facebook, Instagram, Youtube, Twitter, TikTok, and Apple’s App Store, these platforms are all rent-seeking intermediaries. Their shareholders are the kings, nobles, and knights, that run the feudal system that is the internet. As users, we are digital serfs toiling on the land of these corporate overlords.

As a thought experiment, imagine translating the physical world we live in today to the current state of our digital lives.

Everywhere you go, you pay rent to five corporate lords. Your home, where you go to dinner, the clothes you wear, the relationships you forge, the concert you attend, these things and experiences are all owned and controlled by your lords. It’s like we have Stockholm syndrome thinking this is not only acceptable but a beneficial arrangement for humanity.

Imagine for a moment, Twitter as a decentralized protocol owned and governed by its users. As a user, you own your posts/content, get the full benefit of any ad revenue generated by your content, and are rewarded commensurately by your contributions to the platform (your time, data, and creations). You can export your followers to any other platform, the feed algorithm serving you, instead of you serving the algorithm, and being able to adjust the dials on what content you see, at what interval, and time. You have the ability to vote on elected officials who manage operations and R&D based on your proof of humanity and stake in the platform. This is just one silly example, digitally native ownership allows for a better alignment of incentives between creators and their communities. With blockchain, a Twitter protocol owned by users/creators is entirely possible. The web today is built on surveillance capitalism, corporations are using AI to manipulate our behaviors, and as users, we are completely outgunned. I want AI to represent me and my community, crypto offers this alternative. The labor people are already putting into twitter for free should be commensurately rewarded, rewarding users will encourage more labor, and more labor will make it a more meaningful platform. We don’t get there without first stepping over the dead bodies of Elon Musk and other web2 companies, because the incentives aren’t there for them to turn the power/capital over to users.

## The Web in Three Parts

- **Web1**: **Democratized information**. 1990 to 2005. Anyone in the world can go to a search engine, type in something, and read about it.
- **Web2**: **Democratized publishing**. 2005 to 2019. Users can now easily publish and interact with each other’s content. One drawback to web2 is it centralized under the control of just a couple of corporations. Why this happened is a story for another day, but still net positive for humanity. Anyone can publish on Youtube, TikTok, Instagram, etc...
- **Web3**: **Democratizing ownership**. 2019 to…? We can now bake social structures and governance natively into the internet. Incumbents will naturally fight this evolution, but it is inevitable. See [Uniswap](https://uniswap.org/community) as an early primitive example.

### Web3 Parallels with Web1

Do you remember the internet in 1995? That's where web3 is today in terms of user adoption.


![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd5310785-fef0-466c-8172-aa6e953a411d_1755x1141.png)

Eighteen million American homes were “online” in 1995 sense that they had America Online, Prodigy, or CompuServe, but only 3 percent had ever seen the free and open internet.

![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1ab9945f-98ae-4f3e-bb49-b6d3e2f5e3f2_700x362.jpeg)

What crypto skeptics miss is that like the web in 1995, it is early days for crypto.

In 1995, there was no google, but you could use Yahoo, Excite, Altavista, or Lycos, type something into that search bar, and read about it. Dial-up modems were slow, there were scams, and most “reasonable” adults were skeptical it had any real use cases. As a kid, I remember hearing from them:

> "You can't trust what you read on the internet."
> 
> "Why read an article online when I get the newspaper every day."
> 
> "Why order anything online and wait a week when I can go to the store and have it now."
> 
> “Why watch videos online when I have cable TV”
> 
> “Don’t talk to anyone online, they are all child predators”

Crypto skeptics look at it through the lens of where it is today and compare it to the traditional financial system, web applications, and social structures, but they aren't seeing the future potential of crypto. The fundamental underlying technology is inherently more global, more efficient, more fair, and free.

##### Stages of Tech Adoption:

- Step 1 - ignore, the new thing is so nascent that most ignore it.
- Step 2 - refute, incumbents and skeptics try to use logic/reason to argue why the new tech will never work.
- Step 3 - name calling, people get mad. critics realize in their gut that the new thing is important and will reorder power and authority in some way. incumbents get upset, people fear change. tech gets wrapped up in political and social debates. Crypto should be politically agnostic, but it does fundamentally align power with the individuals/communities.
- Step 4 - then the tech wins everyone agrees it was always inevitable. Again, in the long run the truth wins.

Crypto is probably somewhere between steps 2 and 3. A [reminder on popular opinion](https://twitter.com/waitbutwhy/status/1595099381082251264?s=20&t=DPIlZQM3GdEOOkXRUlPjOQ) from Tim Urban.

Looking at all the parallels between the web1 and web3, the rate of adoption, and similar critiques, I'm frankly blown away so many people are missing it. **E-commerce 25 years ago was a sideshow most poked fun at it, but today it's kind of the main thing.** There are endless rabbit holes of possibility one can go down.

### Encryption

SSL encryption (i.e. cryptography - secure communication in the presence of adversarial behavior), which allows us to use credit cards online, view health records, bank, email privately, and basically any other verb we do online and don't want blasted publicly to the world, was once highly controversial.

Who wants to use encryption? In the early 90s, there was a battle in congress to ban it. In 1995, a senator could claim that encryption online is mainly used by terrorists and criminals, and may have actually been right. Obviously, only criminals and terrorists have use for this privacy technology, as they are the ones with something to hide.

128-bit encryption, which isn't as strong as what we use today to shop on lovehoney.com, was classified under the same munitions regulations as tomahawk missiles in the 90s. In fact, it was [illegal to ship/sell Netscape Navigator outside the US](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Export_of_cryptography_from_the_United_States#PC_era) (this was a time when software still came in boxes).

With any new technology, especially one that gives power to individuals, it takes time for the good use cases to emerge. Not all power to individuals is net positive, but unlike assault rifles, crypto already has actual real-world use cases for the betterment of humanity, and we are just scratching the surface of possibilities.

A lot of the same people that are worried today about bad use cases of crypto are also worried about privacy online. Is banking secure, health info secure, power grid secure? On net, overwhelmingly, we would much rather live in a world with encryption and the privacy it provides.

The same concept applies to money. Criminals and terrorists use money all day long, but positive use cases for money strongly outweigh the bad ones. This is why the terrorist/criminal critique of crypto holds no water long term.

## The Metaverse

The word “metaverse” has been thrown around so much over the last couple years it is borderline cringe and meaningless. Thanks to Zuckerberg, people think the metaverse is some kind of VR thing. VR is about immersion, in my opinion and other crypto natives, the metaverse is different entirely.

The average American adult spends more waking time looking at a screen than not. Whether you are scrolling Insta/TikTok, on a zoom call at work, Facetiming your mom, watching Netflix, or playing Fornite, you are living in new frontiers of the digital human experience. But that time spent is often just entertainment or escapism. Most of the meaningful digital experiences today are the ones that tie back to the physical world in some way.

To paraphrase Herman Narula, Disneyland is immersive, there is a lot of fulfillment and engagement, but it is a consumptive experience. Disneyland is not changed by me having been there. I could get married at Disneyland, and the rest of my life changes, it's the real world where the meaning of marriage is relevant, but Disneyland is the same tomorrow. “That's not a world I inhabited, that's just a movie I saw.”

So when do these digital experiences become a metaverse, or part of our reality?

The metaverse becomes real when we have a network of meaning, where we can transfer value, identity, objects, and things across digital experiences. What technology enables this type of network? Blockchain. It is the **ownership** layer, the **scarcity** layer, the **meaning** layer of the metaverse. The official record, interoperable with any digital experience built on top of it, available as a public good to everyone and controlled by everyone.

My identity, my marriage, the shoes I bought last week, the book I’m reading, my tattoo, I can take them to and from whatever digital experience I want. They aren't controlled by a corporation, they are mine, outright, in perpetuity. If I did nothing, they will be with me until I die. If I want to wear a digital t-shirt I bought yesterday to a virtual live concert, there needs to be composability and interoperability between these experiences for it to be a metaverse.

If I'm at a crowded concert in the metaverse watching Jamie XX, I want to be able to yell, and for him to maybe hear me. I want to be able to tell a joke to a random person next to me and for them to have a laugh, if there is no cause and effect, the immersion is pointless. When Romy comes up at encore for a surprise guest performance, I want to be able to say “I was there”. Travis Scott "live" in Fortnite VR sharded across a bunch of servers where he can't hear me yell and there are only a few people actually next to me is lame AF. It could be the most immersive thing ever, but nobody was actually “there” because it wasn’t a singular shared experience. **Whether or not an experience is physical or digital is less relevant than asking if it is unfolding in real-time as a singular experience or if it is prerecorded or sharded.**

**The metaverse isn't an alternative reality, it is MORE reality.** It's not about escapism or entertainment, but about connection and meaning. this is the fundamental piece. **Blockchains enable the transfer of meaning across experiences.** **The idea that it is a place you leave and go into is what is isolating about the conventional definition of the metaverse**. Blockchain enables a network of meaning that connects digital experiences to the physical world.

Most things in life are non-fungible, your car, your apartment, your marriage. Outside of money, they are actually very few things truly fungible that matter. In the metaverse, the fungible money piece of crypto is just a small sliver of reality, NFTs will be the predominant underlying technology enabling the interoperability of unique things between experiences. And most NFTs will be worthless from a financial perspective, just like your 5yo daughter’s artwork. **The point isn’t to make everything a financial instrument, but for humanity to have a shared record of meaning.**

We forget about the huge gap between the haves and have-nots in terms of meaningful experiences. The metaverse opens up all kinds of meaning regardless of geography or access.

The metaverse requires societal buy-in.

- Why do we care about sports, arbitrary games where we kick and throw balls up and down made-up fields with made-up rules? Why is it important or have value? Is it about money? No, money is the byproduct of its importance.
- Sports are a type of religion. Society collectively buys in that it is important. When I'm at a game, yelling with the crowd around me, strangers finding shared meaning together, or at home watching with my family or friends on TV, it's the shared experience that gives it meaning
- You need willing consent at large to decide the made-up thing has value.
- you play a video game, society plays the metaverse.

## Frontier

There was a time when the frontier was the wild west, there was a time when it was conquistadors and people setting sail in the age of sail.

In my opinion, the frontier today isn't in physical meatspace, it's not the sea, or the desert, or even outer space, the frontier is in digital space.

To quote Naval, "the digital frontier is within web3 and crypto because it is the least regulated, most decentralized, most permissionless, 24x7x365 markets that are self-funding. Anyone in the world with an internet connection can participate, no credentials required."

One of the signals that you are on the frontier, is if things are dangerous. Like the wild west in America or vast oceans during the age of sail, in crypto and web3 there is danger everywhere. Between scams, hacks, accidental losses, clunky and confusing UI, highly volatile assets, lack of regulatory clarity, and regulation by enforcement, there is plenty to be scared of.

Many of the overzealous crypto fanboys don't adequately right-size that risk. There is a get-rich-quick mentality, instead, crypto proponents should think less about financial gains and focus more on building something useful over the long term for the betterment of humanity. Sure, there is hard work in weathering market cycles and uncertainties (hodling), it will test conviction, but there is more to frontier living than weathering storms. **Help build the railroad and towns that enables the next generation of settlers.** After all, unlike the wild west in this analogy, rather than displacing marginalizing indigenous populations, the crypto frontier and fundamental value proposition is set to reorder power and authority by taking it away from the exploitative elites that pull the strings today.

## Most of crypto is bad

Most tokens are worthless garbage. In a permissionless free open market, there will be endless scams for as long as they are profitable, this isn’t the walled garden of Apple’s App Store. In my opinion, there are only a small handful of tokens worth paying attention to.

Because of network effects and first mover advantage, as the first [smart contract](https://ethereum.org/en/smart-contracts/) platform I think Ether is the likely base layer currency for the future global economy (bitcoin is fine as a store of value but is less interesting to me for a variety of reasons, a topic for another day). See [ultrasound.money](https://ultrasound.money/) for a little more on Ethereum market dynamics.

Other chains may have great future use cases, but I like Ethereum’s modular design, focusing on decentralization at the base layer instead of performance and scaling with [layers 2s](https://ethereum.org/en/layer-2/). Most “Ethereum killers” implement a monolithic design, they are more performant at the base layer but sacrifice decentralization in the process. See [blockchain trilemma](https://www.ledger.com/academy/what-is-the-blockchain-trilemma) for more on these trade-offs. Because of the plasticity of turing-complete smart contracts, I imagine Ethereum will be the protocol layer of meaning that powers the metaverse, with many performant side chains and L2s managing high TPS use cases while settling back to Ethereum Mainnet. **In the future, the only users of Ethereum Mainnet will be other chains/L2s.**

Only 8% of Americans have a positive view of crypto today? [An informative letter from Howard Marks on asymmetric bets and herd mentality](https://www.oaktreecapital.com/docs/default-source/memos/2014-04-08-dare-to-be-great-ii.pdf).

## **Quick aside on Politics**

On the subject of crypto, Jamie Dimon and Elizabeth Warren make odd bedfellows. As an establishment incumbent of the financial system money crypto values propose to disrupt, when Jamie tells congress that crypto is just “decentralized Ponzi schemes, and the notion they are good for anybody is unbelievable”, his motivations are obvious. Warren, on the other hand, seems well-intentioned but misguided by her more tech-savvy advisors. **They say the road to hell is paved with good intentions, and I hope Warren zooms out, starts from first principles, and sees how crypto will be a great equalizer and force for good in the long run.** She is right that today a lot of the industry is scams and smoke and mirrors.

Solar panels are universally loved by both based leftists and survivalist libertarians. Crypto should be embraced by folks on both ends of the political spectrum in the same way, as the tech both enables individual freedoms and provides a more fair and equitable future for all.

Software is as flexible/plastic as fiction, and there’s no reason crypto should be a political debate for those that believe in shrinking the global opportunity gap. **If your goal is to maximize the number of people on earth that can live healthy meaningful lives, there is no question that enabling meaningful digital experiences will increase those opportunities.** Also, as someone intimately familiar with the environmental cost of building in the real world, having meaningful digital experiences will also significantly reduce carbon emissions long term.

Too idealistic? That’s likely the same reaction a peasant living during feudalism would have when pitched the concept of democracy. Congress needs to pass clear legislation/regulation of centralized crypto entities (exchanges, stablecoin issuers, etc…). The regulation by enforcement we live with today just furthers the ambiguity that enables scammers and offshores innovation. Congress needs to show us they care more about protecting the American public than they care about protecting financial service incumbents (JP Morgan, Goldman Sachs, Wells Fargo, etc…), so far the lack of legislation suggests that elites would rather see crypto die a failed experiment than give it the legitimacy of thoughtful legislation and a chance to thrive.

I encourage those young or open-minded enough to consider themselves internet natives to **seize the means of production at the protocol layer**. The window of plasticity is not infinite, this is the only time in human history we will have the chance. Which side of history are you on?
